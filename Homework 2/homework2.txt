Problem 1:
Expansion sequence:
(Lugoj,f=244,g=0,h=244)
(Mehadia,f=311,g=70,h=241)
(Drobeta,f=387,g=145,h=242)
(Craiova,f=425,g=265,h=160)
(Timisoara,f=440,g=111,h=329)
(Pitesti,f=503,g=403,h=100)
(Bucharest,f=504,g=504,h=0)

Remaining open list after completion:
(Riminuci Vilcea,f=604,g=411,h=193)
(Arad,f=595,g=229,h=366)

Expand Lugoj, adding Mehadia and Timisoara to open list. Expand Mehadia, adding Drobeta to open list. Expand Drobeta, adding Craiova to open list. Expand Craiova, adding Rimnicu Vilcea and Pitesti to open list. Expand Timisoara, adding Arad to open list. Expand Pitesti, adding Bucharest to open list. Bucharest is now the lowest F value so A* is complete.

Problem 2:
A)
BFS:
State 1 expands to State 2 and 3
State 2 expands to State 4 and 5
State 3 expands to State 6 and 7
State 4 expands to State 8 and 9
State 5 expands to State 10 and 11
State 6 expands to State 12 and 13
State 7 expands to State 14 and 15
State 8 expands to State 16 and 17
State 9 expands to State 18 and 19
State 10 expands to State 20 and 21
State 11 is found and the search stops


Depth-Limited:
State 1 expands to State 2 and 3
State 2 expands to state 4 and 5
State 4 expands to state 8 and 9
State 8 expands to state 16 and 17
Wont expand 16 and 17 due to depth limit of 3
State 9 expands to state 18 and 19
Wont expand 18 and 19 due to depth limit of 3
State 5 expands to state 10 and 11
State 10 expands to state 20 and 21
Wont expand 20 and 21 due to depth limit of 3
State 11 is found and the search stops

Iterative Deepening:
limit starts at 0
State 1 expands to state 2 and 3

limit is increased to 1
State 1 expands to state 2 and 3
State 2 expands to State 4 and 5
State 3 expands to State 6 and 7

limit is increased to 2
State 1 expands to state 2 and 3
State 2 expands to State 4 and 5
State 4 expands to State 8 and 9
State 5 expands to State 10 and 11
State 3 expands to State 6 and 7
State 6 expands to State 12 and 13
State 7 expands to State 14 and 15

limit is increased to 3
State 1 expands to state 2 and 3
State 2 expands to State 4 and 5
State 4 expands to State 8 and 9
State 8 expands to State 16 and 17
State 9 expands to State 18 and 19
State 5 expands to State 10 and 11
State 10 expands to State 20 and 21
State 11 is found and the search stops



B)
Bidirectional sort should be optimal for this problem since all edges have the same undefined cost.

Order:
State 1 expands to state 2 and 3
State 11 expands to state 5
State 2 expands to state 4 and 5
State 5 expands to state 2, which has already been expanded so the search is complete

Branching factor for the downward search (starting at state 1) is 2.
Branching factor for the upward search (starting at state 11) is 1.

Problem 3
a) True

b) True

c) True

d) False

e) True

f) True

g) True

h) False

i) True

problem 4

Advantage: Iterative Deepening requires less memory overall compared to BFS.
Disadvantage: Becuase Iterative Deepening restarts the search each time the depth-limit is increased, the amount of nodes expanded is significantly higher.
